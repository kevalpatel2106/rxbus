# RxBus
#### Implementation of event bus using Rx for Android.

## Gradle dependency: 
- Add below dependency into your build.gradle file.

```compile 'com.kevalpatel2106:rxbus:1.0'```

## How to use?
- To post an event,

```
RxBus.getDefault().post(new Event(YOUR_OBJECT_TO_PASS));
```

- To register the event,

```
//Register the event to the bus
RxBus.getDefault().register(Point.class)
        .doOnSubscribe(new Consumer<Disposable>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(@NonNull Disposable disposable) throws Exception {
                mDisposable = disposable;   //Hold the disposable.
            }
        })
        .subscribe(new Consumer<Event>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(@NonNull Event event) throws Exception {
              YOUR_OBJECT = (YOUR_OBJECT)    EVENT.GEToBJECT();
              
              //Do something with the object.
            }
        });
```

- To unregister the event, dispose the disposable received in `onDispose()`.

```
//Unregister from the event bus.
if (mDisposable != null) mDisposable.dispose();
```
